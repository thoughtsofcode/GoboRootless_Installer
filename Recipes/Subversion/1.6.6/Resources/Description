Subversion is a version control system much like the Concurrent Versions
System (CVS). Version control systems allow many individuals (who may be
distributed geographically) to collaborate on a set of files (typically
source code). Subversion has all the major features of CVS, plus certain new
features that CVS users often wish they had.
